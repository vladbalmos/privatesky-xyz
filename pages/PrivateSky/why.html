    <psk-chapter title="Why">
        The open source PrivateSky platform is built and maintained by a mixed industry team of university researchers who are passionate and dedicated to the idea of ​​improving programming in general,
        programming applications on the internet in particular with a focus on security and data protection using cryptographic protocols and new organizational architectures. of data.
        PrivateSky is the result of a type of research that neither big companies, startups nor universities can do for different reasons.
        On the one hand large companies and startups have budgetary constraints and am internal organizational complexity that typically prevents the existence of a sufficient number of
        iterations (partial failures). Our team has worked in different forms in exploring the concept of swarm communication and choreography for almost 10 years. On the other hand, very few
        universities have programmers and architects with enough industry experience to explore such directions.

    <psk-chapter  title="How">
        <p>The direct collaboration between programmers and architects with 10-20 years experience in industry and researchers from the university led us to a series of significant
            results in order to improve the object-oriented programming. Our approach does not try to propose radical paradigm shifts, for example we believe that imperative programming
            and object-oriented programming are rather worth be improved and not eliminated.
        </p>

        <p>Although we recognize the value of functional programming or type-oriented programming (eg Haskel), a refusal to look for ways to improve OOP and imperative programming seems
            to be flawed and inadequate. In this sense, the central point of our research is to replace the metaphor of "objects" with "processes" and not with pure functions, monads or other
            mathematical abstractions.</p>

        <p>In the years since we worked on SwarmESB and PrivateSky projects, we have iterated new ideas that sometimes went away from current fashion and why it was considered "best practice".
            Changing your point of view and habits is difficult and only in retrospect can you see how obvious some ideas are. We are trying to guess which direction should be developed in relation
            to the current state of programming science. Although we were often disappointed with object-oriented programming (OOP), we have long looked at ways to reuse the huge experience
            of this programming model. We don't think the industry needs programming languages ​​or frameworks that can only be used by geniuses who have been studying complex mathematical concepts for years.
            Rather, we believe that we should have tools that offered the possibility to program as close to the essential complexity of the problem (the tools should not add artificial complexity). </p>

    <psk-chapter  title="Innovations">
        It happened that our research and development effort leaded us to build the PrivateSky programming platform.
        PrivateSky offer new approaches when doing Blockchain, MicroServices, Integration, composition of services using Executable Choreographies.
        In the blockchain area we propose the concept of Hierahical Blockchain Domains, Self Sovereign Applications to improve the DApps concept.
