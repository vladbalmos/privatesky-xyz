  <psk-chapter title="Options">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>create csb </b><i>alias constitutionPath</i><br>
        Creates a privatesky domain as a new CSB that contains the constitution at <i>constitutionPath</i>. This command generates a CSB whose SEED is associated locally (inside the SeedCage) with the <i>alias</i> argument. A prompt that requires the insertion of a PIN will appear. The provided PIN will be required for all subsequent commands.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>create bar </b><i>alias localPath</i><br>
        Creates a BAR that stores the files at <i>localPath</i>. The command generates a BAR whose SEED is associated locally (inside the SeedCage) with the <i>alias</i> argument.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>add folder </b> <i>barAlias barPath localPath</i><br>
        Adds the files at <i>localPath</i> to the BAR whose SEED is associated locally with the <i>barAlias</i> argument. The files are added in BAR at bar <i>barPath</i>.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>update constitution</b> <i>domainAlias constitutionPath</i><br>
        Replaces the constitution in the domain whose SEED is associated with <i>domainAlias</i> with the constitution at <i>constitutionPath</i>.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>add agent</b> <i>domainAlias agentAlias</i><br>
        Adds agent <i>agentAlias</i> to the domain whose SEED is associated with <i>domainAlias</i>. A prompt for PIN introduction will appear.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>publish</b> <i>domainAlias remoteAddress</i><br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>set pin</b><br>
        Allows the change of PIN. Firstly, a prompt that requires the current PIN will appear. After the PIN is validated another prompt will appear for the introduction of the new PIN.<br><br>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>anchor</b> <i>anchoreeAlias anchoratorAlias</i><br>
        Allows the anchoring of the domain whose SEED is associated locally with the <i>anchoreeAlias</i> argument inside the domain whose SEED is associated with the <i>anchoratorAlias</i>. By anchoring it is meant that “anchorator” domain contains the hash of the anchorated domain, thus reflecting each change of the latter in the former.<br><br>

      <b>Concept</b> | <b>Description</b>
      BAR | An archive that stores files that were
      | previously divided into blocks called bricks.
      | A BAR is referenced by its SEED. The SEED
      | could be also used to encrypt the archive.
      |
      |
      CSB | An encrypted BAR that contains a blockchain.
      |
      |
      SEED | A string used to derive the encryption keys for
      | BARs. It is also used for referencing BARs.
      |
      |
      SEED Cage | A dictionary that stores domainAliases and
      | SEEDs.
      |
      |
      PIN | A string used to derive the key used  for the
      | SEED Cage encryption.
      |
      |
      Domain | A domain is a CSB that stores domain
      | constitutions.
      Domain Constitution | A list of files that contain assets and
      | transactions used for the manipulation of a
      | domain’s blockchain.
